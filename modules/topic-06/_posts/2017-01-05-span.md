# The `<span>` Element

The `<span>` element is the inline equivalent of the `<div>` element. It serves to identify or group content together that requires organization or extra styling.

One specific use for the `<span>` element is to identify text that needs to appear visually unique on the rendered HTML page.

As with the `<div>` element, the `<span>` element should include a class or ID attribute to provide;

- a reference to styling code
- and/or information to developers about the inner content

In the below example, the `<span>` element identifies specific parts of the paragraph statement, and then alter the appearance of those elements in the rendered page.
<br>

```html
<!-- You will learn about this tag next week.  -->
<!-- The style element allows for styling other elements. -->
<style>
    .skill-description { color:red; }
    .art-id { color:blue; }
</style>

<!-- Main Content -->
<p> Michael Musick is the guy building this course.
    He is also an <span class="skill-description">electo-acoustic
    musician</span> who makes <span class="art-id">installation art
    </span> and performs <span class="art-id">improvised noise

</p>
```

<div class="displayed_code_example">
<style>
    .skill-description { color:red; }
    .art-id { color:blue; }
</style>
