# Topic 06: <br /> HTML Pt. 3
In the first Topic we spent time with an overview of this course itself, the Internet, the web, and what a web developer is. This Topic will build on these ideas by introducing our course text editor that will be utilized throughout your time here.

This includes:

- Text Documents
- Text Editors
- Markdown (`.md`)

## Continuation of Project 2
The second part of this project will ensure you have a functioning work station for this course, resulting in your first live web page.
