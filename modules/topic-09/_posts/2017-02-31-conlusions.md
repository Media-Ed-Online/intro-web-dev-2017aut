# Weekly Conclusions

This week we covered a lot of new material, but all of this material together allows you to start creating engaging webpages.

Make sure you are comfortable with;

- The "Box Model"

Along with the relevant parts of the box model, including;

- padding
- margin
- and border

These properties of block level elements are critical in creating readable pages with appropriate space between portions of the content.


<br />

This week also presented the display and float properties, which can be used to create layouts with horizontal block level elements. This can be used to create headers and menu bars, as well as larger content containers like side bars.

<br />




## Next Week

Next week we will look, in detail, how to use these techniques, as well as "flex flow" to design webpage layouts. While you are on the internet for other purposes this week, take the time to consider what site layouts you like and do not like. You should also change the width of your browser, to see how these sites change depending on the browser size.
