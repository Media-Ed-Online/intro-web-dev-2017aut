## Comments in Code:

Before we get too far, did you know you can leave notes for youself inside your code _as_ you work?

Comments in code allow developers to leave information that is for other human developers only. Computers and processors ignore comments in code.

Let’s go over a few reasons why you may want to include comments in your code.

1. **_Messages_** - Primary comments convey information about code. Typically, this means _why_ some code was written in a certain way, or may also point out information to those collaborating on code together.
2. **_Reminders_** - Comments can be used to remind you want you are working on. You may make notes to yourself about the goal of your work or how you think you may go about solving a problem.
3. **_TODO:_** - Comments can be used to remind you what _else_ you have to do. A very common use of comments is to place “`TODO: `“ within your code along with what it is you still need to _todo_. There are even packages from editors, such as Atom, that can [show you a list of your remaining TODO’s](https://atom.io/packages/todo-show) in a project or simply [highlight your TODO’s for you to easily see](https://github.com/atom/language-todo).
4. **_Notes_** - They are a way for you to communicate intention and thought to the instructor and TA grading your homework this semester.
5. **_Testing_** - You can turn code snippets on or off by delineating them as comments. This is useful when hunting for errors or trying different ways of styling content.


### For HTML
Comments are designated slightly different in every language. In HTML however, as with everything else, they are designated using a tag. Anything placed within this tag will be ignored by the browser.

**NOTE:** Comments are not hidden from other _people_. Comments, if included in your deployment code, will be available for the whole world to see.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!-- This is an HTML comment -->
<!-- Everything placed between the 'dashes' is part of the comment. -->

<!-- Comments should not span multiple lines in HTML.
        Sometimes this can cause issues for a browser's processor.

        This comment is considered as bad style. -->

<!-- Instead, -->
<!-- You should place each line of a multi-line comment within a comment tag. -->
<!-- That would be considered proper style. -->
```
