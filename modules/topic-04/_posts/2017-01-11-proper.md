## Nobody Likes Rude Code

It may seem ridiculous or silly, but there's such a thing as being a respectful dev that writes clean, proper code.

What does this look like? Well, a site with well-written markup will have:

1. Logical or Liner Ordering
2. Properly Nested Tags
3. Indented Elements

There are many other unspoken rules you can Google, but those 3 are my major pet peeves when done poorly - _and I'm likely to call you out on them._

### Ordering
Most languages read and process top-to-bottom, so its important to list these elements linearly and/or logically down the page.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <body>
        <!-- This is improper ordering of blocks. -->
        <!-- The footer should come after the main content. -->
        <div class="footer">
            <p>(C) Justine Evans, 2017</p>
        </div>
        <div id="mainBody">
            <h1>"Debt"</h1>
            <h2>A sonnet about student loans.</h2>
        </div>
    </body>
</html>
```

### Burrito Those Tags
We "wrap" elements in opening and closing tags, as you know. You're now familiar with single-tag element sets like `<p>...</p>`, but elements can actually have multiple sets of tags. It's considered proper to layer these sets in concentric orbits around the element.

This basically looks like `<tag3><tag2><tag1>...</tag1></tag2></tag3>`

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <body>
        <!-- From a recently released deleted scene: -->
        <p>Spengler: "There's something very important I forgot to tell you."</p>
        <p>Venkman: "What?"</p>
        <p>Spengler: "Dont cross the streams."</p>
        <p>Venkman: "Why?"</p>
        <p>Spengler: "It would be bad. Almost as bad as <a href="https://youtu.be/jyaLZHiJJnE"><u><i>improperly nesting HTML tags.</p></a></i></u>
        <p>Venkman: "What's proper?"</p>
        <p>Spengler: <a href="https://youtu.be/jyaLZHiJJnE"><u><i>This</i></u></a>.</p>
    </body>
</html>
```

True story.


### Indentation
There isn't total protocol for indent depth, although standard procedure is to indent one tab (or 2 spaces) for each new element that is a child of the one above it.

Indentation doesn't effect how the page renders, but makes a **huge** difference in the readability of the code.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>

<html>
    <body>
        <!-- This is a mess, and considered in poor taste: -->
          <ul id="main-navigation">
  <li><a href="#">Home</a>
    </li><li><a href="/about">About</a></li><li>
                  <a href="/contact">Contact Me</a></li></ul>
        <!-- This is considered best practice: -->
        <ul id="main-navigation">
          <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
          <li><a href="/about">About</a></li>
          <li><a href="/contact">Contact Me</a></li>
        </ul>
    </body>
</html>
```

An extreme example would be the nested list from the previous page:

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="ZXbPar" data-default-tab="html" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-04: HTML Lists Pt. 3" class="codepen"></p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
