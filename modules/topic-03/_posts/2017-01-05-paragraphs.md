There are some things you should be aware of with paragraphs and browsers.

### Empty Space
By default, browsers will remove empty spaces from paragraph element blocks. This is true of spaces and extra empty lines. You need to be aware that you cannot change the output of your rendered HTML code by adding extra spaces or lines.

The following will both display as single line paragraphs after being rendered.

<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="qXwEbW" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-01: Paragraphs 1" class="codepen"></p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


### Line Breaks
If you want to force a line break inside a paragraph, you can use the break tag. `<br />`

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="ZJZYQq" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-02: Paragraph Element Pt. 2" class="codepen"></p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


### Horizontal Rules
A horizontal rule is a line that runs across the browser window. These can be used to visually differentiate content in a document.

Please note that line breaks `<br />` and horizontal rules `<hr />` are known as 'empty elements'. An â€˜empty element' only has one tag. Before the closing bracket of an empty element there will often be a space and a forward slash character. It is a good habit to get into writing these tags in this way.

<p data-height="400" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="eEomzb" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-02: Paragraph Element Pt. 3" class="codepen"></p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


### Pre-Formatted Text Element
You can use the pre element `<pre>...</pre>` to tell a browser to render spaces and text exactly as you've typed.

This tag usually displays the contents of the element in a fixed-width font, as it is primarily used for preformatted code. However, it can also be used for preformatted text.

This is one method that could be used to present a _poem_ in a browser while maintaining appropriate formatting.

<p data-height="600" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="QMPwKm" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="Topic-02: Paragraph Elements Pt. 4" class="codepen"></p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>
