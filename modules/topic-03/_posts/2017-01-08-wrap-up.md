# Wrap-Up: <br /> Internetting Pt. 3

### Covered Materials:

#### Techonologies
In these first two topics we have gone over a number of technologies that are necessary for web developers. To recap, these now included:

- GIT VCS and GUI App
- GitHub.com

You now have all the tools you need to become web developers! Congratulations on completing this new set-up. Going forward, all you'll need to is learn new languages and push changes to GitHub.com!

#### Languages
You should now have a basic grip on HTML and know how to communicate with GitHub.com using the GitHub Desktop Application. Both are required to complete Project 1 (and all projects going forward).

# Homework
You are expected to have completed these tasks:
1. Synched your homework directory to your GitHub.com account.
2. Completed 'Project 1,' _My First Web Page!_, as per the requirements found on its [Project Board](https://github.com/Media-Ed-Online/intro-web-dev/projects/7).
3. Submitted a link to your (1) `/project-1` repo and (2) live site to the Moodle Workshop.
