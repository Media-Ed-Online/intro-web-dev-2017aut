# The `<div>` Element

Up till this point, all elements that we have looked at have had specific structural or semantic purposes (i.e. defining a paragraph, heading, emphasized text, or including images). There are however, elements that provide structure, without necessarily implying styling or content.

The `<div>...</div>` element offers developers a block-level element to group other elements together.

This element is heavily used by developers to increase structural clarity and identify element groups. This in turn, increases readability, which is always desired. 

This element also serves as an easy way to wrap content to style via CSS. By itself, the sole styling implied by the `<div>` element is that it will start on a new line.

## Example Usage

```html
<div class="page-header" id="page-header" style="display:inline;">
    <img src="../imgs/buff_icon_left.png" alt="Buffalo Icon" title="Buffalo Icon"
    width="75" height="75" style="display:inline;">
    <h1 class="page-title" style="display:inline">American Sport Descriptions</h1>
    <img src="../imgs/buff_icon_right.png" alt="Buffalo Icon" title="Buffalo Icon"
    width="75" height="75" style="display:inline;">
</div>


<div class="content-block" id="football-block">
    <h2 class="card-label">Football</h2>
    <p class="card-description" id="football-description">
    Football is an American sport of strategy and skill. American football
    evolved in the United States, originating from the sports of
    association football and rugby football. The first game of American
    football was played on November 6, 1869, between two college teams,
    Rutgers and Princeton, under rules based on the association football
    rules of the time.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="content-block" id="stock-car-block">
    <h2 class="card-label">Stock-Car Racing</h2>
    <p class="card-description" id="stock-car-description">
    Stock car racing is a form of automobile racing found mainly and most
    prominently in the United States. Traditionally, races are run on oval
    tracks measuring approximately 0.25 to 2.66 miles. The world's largest
    governing body for stock car racing is the American NASCAR, and its
    Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series is the premier top level series of
    professional stock car racing. Top level races typically range between
    200 to 600 miles in length.

## Block Level Elements

Notice in the above code that the use of the `<div>` element creates blocks that appear on a new line.

Block elements appear on their own block on a new line. Other examples of block elements include;

- Headings `<h1>`-`<h6>`
- Paragraphs `<p>`
- Images `<img>`

Each of these, unless told otherwise through styling, appears on a new line in HTML pages.
