# Topic 02: <br /> Internetting Pt. 2
In the first Topic we spent time with an overview of this course itself, the Internet, the web, and what a web developer is. This Topic will build on these ideas by introducing our course text editor that will be utilized throughout your time here.

This includes:

- Text Documents
- Text Editors
- Markdown (`.md`)

## Continuation of Project 1
The second part of this project will ensure you have a functioning work station for this course, resulting in your first live web page.


# Topic Goals
By the end of this Topic, we hope you:

1. Understand the importance of well-organized and -labeled files in web development.
2. Set up a proper folder/directory system for your future homework.
3. Have used markdown to create a proper Readme.md file.
