## Audio in HTML5:
<img src="./../../../img/arrow-divider.svg" style="width: 75px; border: none;" />

Similar to the `<video>` element, the `<audio>` element allows developers to add an audio player to webpages.

## Attributes

The `<audio>` element accepts a number of specific and unique attributes.

#### source

The source attribute (`src=""`) provides a URL (relative or absolute) to the audio file.

#### controls

When the `controls` attribute is supplied it indicates the browser should supply its own controls for playback. If you do not use this attribute, no controls will be shown by default.

#### autoplay

When used, this attribute specifies that the file should play automatically.

**NOTE:** Remember, this is considered poor-practice, and in most cases, it is better to let the user choose whether to start the audio or not.

#### preload

As with the `<video>` element, this attribute tells the browser what to do when the page loads. It can have one of three values:

- `none` - The browser should not load the audio until the user presses play.
- `auto` (default) - The browser should download the audio when the page loads.
- `metadata` - The browser should just collect information such as the size, first frame, track list, and duration.

#### loop

This tells the browser whether or not to loop the audio.


### Browser Support and the Source Tag

Notice that the `<audio>` element is not an "empty element" and requires both an opening and closing tag. This serves a number of purposes, but the most important is that the developer can include content between the tags that will be displayed or called in the case that an end-user's browser does not support the `<audio>` element or audio file format.

You should always include extra markup inside the tags for this potential case.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<audio src="">
    <p>This browser does not support our audio format.</p>
</audio>
```

#### Audio
Best included self-hosted audio formats:

- .mp3: Good quality for file size, but proprietary.
- .ogg: Open-sourced.
- .wav<a href="#lossless-formats">*</a>: Lossless, but larger files.

There are many file formats that audio files can be rendered to. The most popular and well known is likely `.mp3`.

This is because the compression achieved creates smaller file sizes without comprising audio quality too greatly. However, `.mp3` is technically a proprietary format, and as such, some people are hesitant to use it.

If you find yourself working for an audio-based client, they may also have strong opinions about what file types they want prioritized. For example, they may want to use `.ogg` as this is an open-source based audio format.

<p id="lossless-formats">Your clients may also insist that you include lossless or uncompressed audio file formats such as <code>.wav</code>, <code>.aiff</code>, or <code>.flac</code>.</p>


## Attributes

When using more than just `.mp3` you should include multiple versions of the file, with decreasing preference. This allows the browser to then use the file format that it supports.

#### src

This can be done by omitting the `src=""` attribute from the `<audio>` element and instead using a separate `<source>` element inside the parent `<audio>` element.

The `<source>` element is an empty element, and accepts the `src=""` attribute to provide the URL to the browser.


### Altogether Now
<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<h2>Smooth Sounds for "Puppy" Video</h2>
<audio controls>
    <source src="../media/duckett-audio.wav" />
    <source src="../media/duckett-audio.flac" />
    <source src="../media/duckett-audio.ogg" />
    <source src="../media/duckett-audio.mp3" />
    <p>This browser does not support our audio format.</p>
</audio>
```

<div class="displayed_code_example">
    <h3 style="font-family: open sans;">Smooth Jazz</h3>
    <audio controls preload="auto" width="100%">
      <source src="../media/duckett-audio.ogg" />
      <source src="../media/duckett-audio.mp3" />
        <p>This browser does not support our audio format.</p>
    </audio>
</div>
