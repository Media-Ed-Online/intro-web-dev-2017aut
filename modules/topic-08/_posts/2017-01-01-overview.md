# Topic Goals
By the end of this Topic, we hope you:

1. Know how to source fonts from the web.
2. Understand the difference and usage of system, web, and web-safe fonts.
3. Have considered appropriate text styling, balancing "fun" and "functionality" in your site design.

Concluding this Topic, you should have the bulk of your Project 3 completed! This second part should get you laying out your content's stucture in HTML, and using CSS to select and apply font families and text styling. Your last CSS assignment will be about layout, and it will be much easier to implement your ideas when your site content is already decided.
