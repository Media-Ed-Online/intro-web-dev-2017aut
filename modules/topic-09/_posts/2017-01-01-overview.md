# Topic 09: <br /> CSS Pt. 3

This is a significant week, as we will start to look at how we can use CSS to adjust the layout of elements within our websites.

Specifically this week, we will be looking at:

- Element Boxes
    - Height & Width, and setting min and max values
    - Margin
    - Padding
    - Box Borders
    - Hiding Elements
- Inline Block Elements
- Element Position
- Introduction To Layouts
    - Fixed
    - Liquid


## Conclusion of Project 3
The final part of your Project will focus on applying layout principles to the site content you've already created in parts 1 and 2. This includes box models, displays, and an interactive menu.
<p align="center" style="line-height: 0px; text-transform: uppercase; font-size: small; font-weight: bolder; font-family: Lucida Console, monospace; letter-spacing: 1px; color: #EF4A36;">Project Part<br /><img src="./../../../img/project-board-pieces-03.png" style="max-width: 200px; width: 100%; border: none;" /></p>


<!--# Topic Goals
FIX THIS FIX THIS
By the end of this Topic, we hope you:

1. Know how to source fonts from the web.
2. Understand the difference and usage of system, web, and web-safe fonts.
3. Have considered appropriate text styling, balancing "fun" and "functionality" in your site design.

Concluding this Topic, you should have the bulk of your Project 3 completed! This second part should get you laying out your content's stucture in HTML, and using CSS to select and apply font families and text styling. Your last CSS assignment will be about layout, and it will be much easier to implement your ideas when your site content is already decided.
