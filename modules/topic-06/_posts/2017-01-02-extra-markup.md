## Managing Media:<br />(An Overview)
<img src="./../../../img/arrow-divider.svg" style="width: 75px; border: none;" />

To start us off, here's a quick look at what we'll be exploring regarding extra markup and media elements.

### 1. Extra Markup: Additional Structure and Clarity

The first group of elements we will look at include;

- The ID attribute
- The class attribute
- The `<div>` & `<span>` elements
- Escape character codes

These elements, attributes, and codes will offer us additional tools for structuring content and thereby increasing clarity. Not only will these tools offer increased clarity, but they will prove necessary as we move into CSS and consider how to style our pages.

### 2. Media

Building from our work with images and the `<img />` element, we will explore three new elements this Topic that allow for increased media integration and embedding.

The Internet started as a way of sharing scientific content and documents. As the world has quickly progressed however, the way we share information has shifted to necessitating multi-media formats such as audio and video. These elements create options for how we can include this content in our sites.

### 3. Metadata

Metadata is used by browsers, search engines, and developers to better understand specific aspects, qualities, and roles of "things" (in our case webpages). The final set of materials that will be explored this Topic introduce tools for further defining metadata in our webpages. To wrap up this section, an updated basic structure for HTML documents will be presented.
