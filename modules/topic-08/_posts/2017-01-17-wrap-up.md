# Wrap-Up: <br /> CSS Pt. 2

A lot of communicating happens through the textual content of webpages. It is important that your sites create clear, compelling, and readable presentations for your text.

As you can tell from all that has been covered, this goes beyond simply choosing a set of fonts. The presentation of text ventures towards the skill set of expert typographers.

## Part 2/3 of Project 3
Continuing with your chosen theme of **blog**, **article**, or **book, short story, essay, or poem**, you're going to build the bulk of your HTML content and apply decorative styling.


### `sample.html`
This second second page should contain the written piece, either whole or in part. You should spend the majority of your time here.


### `readme.md`
Continue documenting your learning progress in your Project 3 Readme as you go along. This week, below your color palette, add your thought process to selecting your theme, and how your colors and font choices enhance it.


# Homework
You are expected to have completed these tasks:
1. Completed HW-04 from last Topic (your discussion on color in your Readme.md)
2. Completed the HTML and CSS typographical styling requirements for your `sample.html` page for Project 3, _The Literature Showcase_, as per the requirements found on the previous page.
