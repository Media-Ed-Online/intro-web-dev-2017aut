## Doctype Declaration:
<img src="./../../../img/arrow-divider.svg" style="width: 75px; border: none;" />

The **Doctype declaration** simply tells a browser what type of HTML specification your site was written with.

### In the Past
In older versions of HTML and XHTML, the doctype included additional information on the page, as well as a reference link to the specification.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!-- The doctype for HTML 4.01 looks like this: -->
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd">


<!-- Here’s the doctype for XHTML 1.0: -->
<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict //EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd">
```

They’re not very human-readable, but, in their own way, they are simply saying “this document is written in HTML 4.01,” or “this document is written in XHTML 1.0.”

### In the Now: HTML5
You might expect the doctype declaring “this document is written in HTML5” would have the number five in it somewhere. It doesn’t. The doctype for HTML5 looks like this:

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
```

The doctype declaration should be the **first** thing in your HTML file; on line 1.
