# The Language Reference

According to the World Wide Consortiums standards, you should include a language attribute (`lang=""`) inside the opening html tag of a document. This specifies the primary language of the site.

```html
<html lang="en">
```

You can view a list of [language codes on W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_language_codes.asp).
