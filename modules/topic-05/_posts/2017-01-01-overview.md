Time to get into the juicier HTML elements. This Topic, you'll be introduced to some multi-part elements, including:

- Links
    - Using absolute links to the pages _outside_ you site
    - Using relative links on the pages _inside_ your site
- Images
    - How to add images
    - File types to use in specific situations
    - Image sizes
    - Using the Figure element with the Image Element
- Tables
    - Structure
    - Styling
- Forms
    - Various form elements
    - How to create forms

<!--Please notice that there is a lot of material this week. Please give yourself the necessary time to get through the lecture material and complete the homework.-->

## Continuation of Project 2
The second part will be your first encounter with using and linking multiple pages in your site. You'll also be exposed to one of your greatest tools as a dev - images - and how we can use tables and forms to collate data.

# Topic Goals
By the end of this Topic, we hope you:

1. Explore how images work on the web.
2. Understand how elements can be stringed together to better describe, present, and gather information.
3. See how your directory structure influences how your files interact and link on your site.

By the end of this Topic, you should have the bulk of your Project 2 completed! This second part will contain a page for your Instructable's instructions, **and** a page to gather information from a potential viewer - like a quiz over your lesson, a place to upload a picture of their completed dish, or an order form for craft supplies or parts. Your choice!
