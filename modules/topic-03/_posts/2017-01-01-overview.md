# Topic 03: <br /> Internetting Pt. 3
By now you should have your first `README.md`, the technical write-up for _Project 1_, written in the laguage of doctumentation - **Markdown.**

Now, we start to build. This Topic, we will look GIT technology and how we push our native work to the web. We will cover a very brief look at HTML, and will culminate in your Project 1 submisssion (_My First Web Page!_).

This includes:

- Git Version Control
- GitHub
- Beginning HTML (`.html`)

## Conclusion of Project 1
The third and final part of this project will ensure you have a functioning work station for this course, resulting in your first live web page.
