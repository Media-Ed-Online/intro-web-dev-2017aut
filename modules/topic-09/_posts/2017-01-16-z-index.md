## Z-Index:
<img src="./../../../img/arrow-divider.svg" style="width: 75px; border: none;" />

On the last page, we learned how to place elements "wherever" we want. We even learned how to place elements over other elements, thereby, blocking those elements.

The z-index property allows developers to specify which elements should be placed on top of other elements. The z-index property takes an integer number as its value (i.e. -1000 to 1000). Those elements with higher z-index values will be drawn on top elements with lower values.

### An Example

The following example comes from an [article on the Mozilla Developers Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Positioning/Understanding_z_index/Adding_z-index).

Notice a few things about this example.

1. `DIV #1` was given a position value of `absolute` and `z-index: 5`.
    - This is causing it to be placed on top of all other elements.
    - Even the yellow element `DIV #5`. That is because the yellow element did not have a position property setting.
4. Likewise, `DIV #4` is also placed on top of the yellow `DIV #5` element.
5. The green `DIV #2` is placed on top of `DIV #4` since it has a higher z-index, but underneath `DIV #1`.
6. The blue, `DIV #3` was placed underneath all other elements, even the yellow `DIV #5`.
    - This is because it was given a negative z-index (`-2`).
    - This allows it to be placed under `DIV #3`, even though `DIV #3` cannot be placed above other elements with position values specified.
