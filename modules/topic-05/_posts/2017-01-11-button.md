## Buttons:
<img src="./../../../img/arrow-divider.svg" style="width: 75px; border: none;" />

Buttons are common interactive features in web design, and can provide graphic interest as well as functionality to your links and fields.

### The File Upload Element

The file upload element (`type="file"`), is used to allow a user to;

1. Open a navigation window
2. Select a file
3. Upload it to the URL specified in the "`action=""`" attribute.

Most of the visual appearance for this type of box, as well as the subsequent 'file browser' will be dictated by the users browser & OS

**NOTE:** With this element, due to the nature of the data, you need to set the "method" attribute to "post" (`method="post"`).

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="zEzxOV" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: Botton Input Elements, Pt. 1" class="codepen"></p>
<script async src="https://production-assets.codepen.io/assets/embed/ei.js"></script>


### The Submit Button

The submit button is used to send a form to a server. This is the _one_ form type that **does not** require a name attribute.

The `value=""` attribute is used to specify the text that appears on the button. It is good practice to always specify this, as opposed to allowing the browser to use its default "submit query" text.

The appearance of submit buttons is dictated by individual browsers. However, these can be styled using CSS.

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="wreBBp" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: Botton Input Elements, Pt. 2" class="codepen"></p>


### The Image Button

You can use an image for a submit button. Use the `type="image"`.

**NOTE:** This element will then need to follow good image use practice. This means it should include the `alt`, `width`, and `height` attributes following the `src` attribute.

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="KXqwVG" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: Botton Input Elements, Pt. 3" class="codepen"></p>


### The Button Element

The button element (`<button>...</button>`) was introduced to allow users more control over how their buttons appear.

This element also allows other elements to appear inside the button (between the tags).
This means you can combine text and images between the button tags.

<p data-height="300" data-theme-id="30567" data-slug-hash="wreBmE" data-default-tab="html,result" data-user="Media-Ed-Online" data-embed-version="2" data-pen-title="[Intro-Web-Dev] Topic-05: Botton Input Elements, Pt. 4" class="codepen"></p>


#### The Hidden Input Form Element


There is a hidden input element (`type="hidden"`) for form control. These form controls are not shown on the page (although you can see them if you use the browsers "View Source" option).

This input type allows web page authors/developers to add values to forms that users cannot see, but which will be sent along with the form to the server.

For example, a web page author might use a hidden field to indicate which page the user was on when they submitted a form.

<div id="code-heading">HTML</div>
```html
<form action="http://www.example.com/add.php">
    <input type="hidden" name="bookmark" value="lyrics" />
</form>
```
